span {
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
  width: 80px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightblue;

p {
  border: 2px solid red;

/* 

* So the first thing that we need to know is that we have two 
containers here the first being a p tag that is red border the second 
being span tag that is blue now the other thing that we need to know here 
is this that span is not going to respect the space between our containers 
now for the span we declared it to be inline block and what this means is that 
we want the blue container to separate from the red container we talked about 
flex and block and inline something to recap was inline is more so of getting 
the containers into a single line 

* display inline block is a special value of display which provides the 
middle ground between inline and block use this if you don't want an item to 
break onto a line and want to respect the overlapping and space 

* So overall to understand the concept its really simple that we are 
separating the containers with the use of inline block something else that 
we need to understand is the use of the different containers in this case 
we are using two containers in other mode when we had flex or block or inlineflex
we had other li elements in ol here this is a simple span important point
