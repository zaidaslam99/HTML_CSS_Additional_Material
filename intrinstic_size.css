HTML have a natural size before they are affected by any 
CSS a straightforward example is an image an image file contains 
sizing information described as its intrinsic size. This is 
determined by the image itself and not any formatting.

As you can see this code we didn't have to modify the image 
instead what we did was we just put the image in this is 
what is known as the intrinsic size natural size prior to 
any modification
