ul > li {
  border-top: 5px solid red;
  background-color: yellow;
}

/* So here this is known as a child combinator and its placed 
between two css selectors now here this is really simple to 
understand and that being why is it that there are two lines 
that are going to be going on the top of li? and not the ol li
and the answer to that is really simple the first thing that 
we need to understand is that we want li after ul anything past 
that we don't want the second thing that we need to know is notice 
the use of border top and that means this means we want a border 
only for the top of the li thats why its making the two lines 
when we remove the > then it goes back to making that for all 
the li when it comes to the yellow as you can see that its highlight
everything and the reason being its highlighting the first li 
element and then its going to be doing the same for the other li 
and its going to think that everything for the second is going to 
within li so it thinks of it as a block almost in a way */
