/*  

So here we are learning more about the ::before and it makes 
sense all we are doing is that we are putting what we want 
::before into the body of the {} block something else that 
we learned here is that we can also use ::before when it 
comes to class 

When it comes to making a container when we use ::before or 
::after its going to show within the container that is something 
to be aware of here
