/* 

    So here there was something that I learned the very first 
    thing that we need to know is that when it comes to 
    display we are putting grid and what this does is that it 
    helps us position different boxes in different spots 
    around the page something that I learned was that gap is 
    the distance from each of the boxes     

    So when it comes to the fractions part of the grid the thing 
    that we need to keep in mind is that it determines different 
    part of the grid so be aware for that first part is 1 then 2 
    and 3 and fractions work likewise
