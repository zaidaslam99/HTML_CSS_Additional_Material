/* So here is the best way to understand this code the first thing 
that we need to understand is simple now when it comes to positive 40 
it movie the inner square away from the outer square and when it comes to 
negative it brings the two squares closer until it exits the main square 
the best way to think of this is as the when you are going into earth you 
are going positive and when you are going out of the earth that means negative 
so that is why in the first one our box is moving down because its following 
all the laws that we created here */
