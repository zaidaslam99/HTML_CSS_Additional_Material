/* A psuedo class is a selector that selects elements
that are in a specific state they are the first element 
of their type or are being hovered over by a mouse or 
a pointer they tend to act as if you had applied a class 
to some part of your doc often helping you cut down on 
excess class in your markup and giving more better code */
