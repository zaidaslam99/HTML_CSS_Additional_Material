/* 
* General notes when it comes to import the import rule allows the user to import 
style rules from other style sheet either directly into a CSS file or into a 
style element when importing stylesheet the import statement must be defined before any 
css styles within the stylesheet or style block  

* So here notice that we are importing url and then we are importing a layer called 
components something that I learned was that when it comes url it calling this a 
layer as well that is something to be wary of here.

* so that this means is we are importing the css file components-lib into the layer 
components if that file contains any layers named or not those layer become nested 
layers within the components layers
