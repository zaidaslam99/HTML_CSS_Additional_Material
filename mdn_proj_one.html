    <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.</p>
    
    <p>A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. </p>

<!-- So when it comes to the CSS what they did was applied it to the body instead of making div and when it comes to h1 they put the color font size font family and border bottom and when it comes to h2 they put the font size for the web developer they put a class of job-title 
    and changed the color and then the font weight and as far as the a they put it in a div  -->
